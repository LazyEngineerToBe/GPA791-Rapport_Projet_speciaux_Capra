	abstract = {The operator's situational awareness greatly affects mission performance for remote operations of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) robots. Testing by Army EOD sergeants has shown that a Head-Aimed Remote Viewer (HARV) can significantly increase mission performance in several key tasks, such as identifying secondary Improvised Explosive Devices (IED's) and maneuvering in tight quarters. A HARV system improves the operator's situational awareness by providing an intuitive, "look around" vision interface that DARPA research4 has shown provides a 400\% improvement in the operator's spatial understanding of the remote environment. This paper describes the results of functional testing conducted by US Army civilian engineers and EOD sergeants at Picatinny Arsenal, in support of W15QKN-06-C-0190.},

This procedure for collecting workload ratings was developed by the Human Performance Group at NASA Ames Research Center during a three year research effort that involved more than 40 laboratory. simulation. and inflight experiments. Although the technique is still undergoing evaluation. this booklet is being distributed to allow other researchers to use it in their own experiments. Comments or suggestions about the procedure would be greatly appreciated. This package is intended to fill a "nuts and bolts" function of describing the procedure. A bibliography provides background information about previous empirical findings and the logic that supports the procedure.},
